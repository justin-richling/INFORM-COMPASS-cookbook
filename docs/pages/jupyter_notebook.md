### Running the Jupyter Notebook
This cookbook can be run from /glade on Derecho.

#### Login to Derecho
If you haven't already, [login to derecho and clone the repo]({{ site.baseurl }}/derecho/)

#### Set up your environment
Load some standard modules and set up your python environment.

##### Check which modules are available
For more information, see the HPC [Modules](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment-and-software/user-environment/modules/) page.
```tcsh
> module av
```
Activate the conda module
```tcsh
> module load conda
> module av
```
You will now see (L) after conda/latest in the output of the "module av" command indicating that conda has been loaded. **You will have to do this each time you login - it does not persist between login sessions**

##### Set up your Python environment
More info on the HPC [Conda](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment-and-software/user-environment/conda/) documentation page.

The environment stored in the environment.yml file is likely already available to you:
```tcsh
> conda env list
```
To see which env you currently have active
```tcsh
> conda info
```
Activate the NCAR Python Library (npl) environment.
```tcsh
> conda activate npl-2024a
```
You should now see (npl-2024a) at the beginning of your command prompt.

The environment.yml file stored with this code is "npl-2024a".  The "npl" environment always points to the most recent version of the NPL. However, it is recommended that you load a specific version instead if you want to ensure consistent behavior from each installed package.

To create a new environment.yml file (if you ever want to update what is stored with the code):
```tcsh
> conda env export --no-builds -n npl-<year> > environment.yml
```

#### Launch a jupyter environment in your local browser
In order to instantiate a jupyter-lab instance, you will need to access derecho using VNC, FastX (https://fastx.ucar.edu:3300),
 or via jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu. Using this last option:
* In the browser on your local machine, enter the URL: ```jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu```
* Click the Available NCAR Resources option ```Production```
* Login with your standard Duo credentials and respond to the Duo push notification
* Start a server if you don't already have one running
* Select ```derecho``` and click ```start```
* You will see that you are in your home directory on the left.

##### Open a notebook
* Navigate to your INFORM-COMPASS-cookbook checkout.
* Click on one of the ipynb files to view that notebook.
